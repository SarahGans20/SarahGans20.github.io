    <h2>Today's Entry</h2>
    <p>Hello, World! This is my first entry on my brand new blog.
        I just wanted to get started with some really basic stuff.
        This site will document all of the things I am passionate
        about in life, which is why this first entry is about my
        cat, Luna. She is almost five years old and she is my
        favorite. I have included a photo of her for reference!
